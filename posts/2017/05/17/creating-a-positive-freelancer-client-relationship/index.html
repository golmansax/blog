Not only does the work become more enjoyable for both parties, but I am able to ask my client in the future for referrals or a testimonial.</p><p>Here are 3 principles that have helped me become a freelancer that (I think) clients love working with.</p><h3>1. Communicate!</h3><p>In my opinion, communication is the most important aspect of any professional relationship, much less a freelance one.  Communication helps everyone stay on the same page, which significantly decreases the chances a person will be negatively surprised by something.</p><p>Several ways I like to communicate:</p><ul><li>I schedule a call with my clients once a week to ensure they are happy with the direction of my work</li><li>I use a task tracking system (e.g. GitHub Issues, Trello, Phabricator), so that the client doesn&#x27;t have to contact me to see my progress</li><li>I am extremely responsive over email, and will always respond within 12 hours (sometimes even just to say that I will respond with more detail in a week)</li></ul><p><span class="ZoomableImage-container"><img alt="Communication tools" src="//images.contentful.com/ei622yk3qctu/55uOI4Q3xeG4cGQUi8W6us/57e88c0cf74064ade400a027875d5b57/communication-tools.jpg" class="ZoomableImage"/><small class="ZoomableImage-caption">Solid communication tools</small></span></p><h3>2. Produce for the client, not for yourself</h3><p>Before I start work on a project, I always try to get a sense of my my client&#x27;s priorities.  Some care about user experience, some care about performance, some want to launch as soon as possible.  Whatever the client&#x27;s goals are, I am comfortable adapting my style to them.</p><p>For me, it has been important to remember to disregard my own preferences (see next section).  It&#x27;s unproductive for both sides if I spend too much time working on something that the client does not value.</p><h3>3. Offer suggestions, but be prepared to defer</h3><p>Even when my opinion is not directly asked for, I always like to offer my perspective.  One of a freelancer&#x27;s greatest values is his or her previous experiences, and that insight can be extremely valuable to a client without similar experiences.</p><p>Since I have worked with many early-stage startups, my insight regarding deciding whether to build a feature vs. using a workaround has been especially helpful.  For example, my last client wanted to build a email system, but I suggested that Mailchimp could get him 90% there for his use case.  He definitely appreciated the idea, which saved him both time and money.</p><p>However, in cases of disagreement, there&#x27;s no point in putting up a fight.  The project is the client&#x27;s, and they always get the final say.</p><hr/><p>Hope these tips have been useful and will help you build great freelance relationships!
