Tracking my work hours was the change that turned it around.</p><p>When I started the self-employed lifestyle, I thought I would have no trouble working 40 hours a week since I enjoy working and coding.  And because of this mentality, I was initially satisfied with how much I was working.  However, after a year of being self-employed, I realized that I had no sense of how I was spending my time, other than the hours I was billing as a freelancer.  I set out to find a way to hold myself accountable, and decided to track my work hours.</p><p>I googled around for a timer to use, and settled on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a> because it was free and easy to use.  It initially was annoying to remember to clock-in, but I let myself add in hours after the fact, in case I forgot.  Here&#x27;s a graph of my weekly work hours in the first 6 months after I started tracking my time:</p><p><span class="ZoomableImage-container"><img alt="Toggl overview (Sept 2016 - Mar 2017)" src="//images.contentful.com/ei622yk3qctu/9c1hha2D60OmWoGuq4caw/c00ed657b1eb44cd314230d9a5e83bdd/toggl_summary.png" class="ZoomableImage"/><small class="ZoomableImage-caption">My weekly working hours over the first 6 months of time tracking</small></span></p><p>Lo and behold, I worked only 27 hours the first week I tracked my hours!  I totally underestimated the ease of being distracted when there is no external pressure, and I&#x27;m glad I finally became aware of how I was using my time.  After a few unproductive weeks due to traveling abroad and moving to New York, I made it a goal to hit around 40 hours each week.  It&#x27;s nice to see that I&#x27;ve reached a happy equilibrium of working 45 hours a week.</p><p>So far, Toggl has been sufficient for my time tracking needs.  In addition to tracking the time I spend working, I thought it would be interesting to track what project I am working on and where I am working.  I&#x27;m hoping in the future to do a more thorough analysis of my work habits using this data.  Here&#x27;s what my Toggl screen looks like:</p><p><span class="ZoomableImage-container"><img alt="Toggl daily June 7" src="//images.contentful.com/ei622yk3qctu/2jRsZr3YR64WOUEg0G62YY/30ff1b29ae72ea052d21fdef52578501/toggl_daily.png" class="ZoomableImage"/><small class="ZoomableImage-caption">My daily Toggl screen, where I log the project, location, and time for each work session</small></span></p><p>I would highly recommend time tracking for anyone who feels unsure about how they spend their time.  I could see it being useful outside of work as well, for tracking workouts or for learning a skill.  In addition to the benefit of being aware of my time, I feel time tracking has led me to work more, because of the small satisfaction of starting the timer each time I start working.  I hope this tactic helps you as much as it has helped me!</p></div></div></div></div><div><div class="row align-center Footer-section"><div class="large-2 medium-4 hide-for-small-only columns"><div class="Footer-portrait"></div></div><div class="large-6 medium-8 columns Footer-about-container"><h4>About me</h4><div class="Footer-portrait-container show-for-small-only"><div class="Footer-portrait show-for-small-only"></div></div><p>Hi!
