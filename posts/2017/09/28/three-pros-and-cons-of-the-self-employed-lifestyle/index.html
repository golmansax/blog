However, like with everything in life, self-employment also has its drawbacks.  Here are a few ways – good and bad – in which self-employment has affected my day-to-day life.</p><h3>Pro: You choose when you want to work</h3><p>One of my favorite benefits of self-employment is that my work schedule is no longer dictated by someone else.  I&#x27;m able to plan my work life around my personal life, whereas most people do the opposite.</p><p>A prime example of this advantage is my access to off-peak benefits.  The gym, post office, and grocery store are all noticeably emptier during the day, so I don&#x27;t spend time waiting in long lines!  I am generally able to travel during off-peak days and times, which saves both time and money.  Buying off-peak plane tickets during the holidays has been especially great on my wallet.</p><p><span class="ZoomableImage-container"><img alt="Long USPS line" src="//images.contentful.com/ei622yk3qctu/khpCkVldniywm8Ommi8us/b7369c3777a87fa42bdd258f147ec726/usps_line.jpg" class="ZoomableImage"/><small class="ZoomableImage-caption">No more long post office lines! <span class="ZoomableImage-attribution">(image<span> via <a href="http://www.yelp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yelp</a></span>)</span></small></span></p><p>Another benefit of a flexible work schedule: the number of hours you work is up to you.  While I typically like to work around 40 hours per week, there are weeks when I only work 20 hours – like when a friend is visiting from out-of-town – knowing that I can make up the time the following week.  The freedom is awesome, and it’s a great way to build my time management skills!</p><h3>Con: There&#x27;s no external pressure to work</h3><p>A major downside to not having a boss is that you are the only person responsible for how much you work.  The lack of external pressure makes it easy to put work off until later.</p><p>I struggled with this at the beginning of my self-employment, and it wasn&#x27;t until I started <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://golmansax.com/blog/posts/2017/06/08/time-tracking-my-most-effective-productivity-tool-when-self-employed/">tracking my work hours</a> that I became satisfied with the hours I was working and the amount I was completing.  I found that it also helps to have a specific work goal in mind; for example, my goal is to work around 40 hours a week.</p><p><span class="ZoomableImage-container"><img alt="Toggl daily June 7" src="//images.contentful.com/ei622yk3qctu/2jRsZr3YR64WOUEg0G62YY/30ff1b29ae72ea052d21fdef52578501/toggl_daily.png" class="ZoomableImage"/><small class="ZoomableImage-caption">My daily Toggl screen, where I log the project, location, and time for each work session</small></span></p><h3>Pro: You choose where you want to work</h3><p>This benefit mostly applies to those with digital skillsets like myself (I&#x27;m a freelance web developer).  Being able to work from anywhere allows me to live an efficient lifestyle, especially given that I can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-tether-your-cell-phone-as-a-modem-2377918">tether to my phone</a> if the location I&#x27;m working at does not have internet.  Long bus or train rides are no longer a loss of time because I&#x27;m able to work on them.  I can even work when I&#x27;m at a park!</p><p>Another advantage of remote work is the ability to travel more often and for longer.  A perfect example: I&#x27;m currently traveling in Southeast Asia and will still be able to work 20 hours this week.  As mentioned before, I am also able to tack on a few days to my weekend trips to take advantage of weekday flight prices.</p><p><span class="ZoomableImage-container"><img alt="Artistry Cafe, Singapore" src="//images.contentful.com/ei622yk3qctu/3uRqXGvy2ISomsO8WcSMc6/c6b78c9f459f36ad03e5593132a1a98d/artistry.jpg" class="ZoomableImage"/><small class="ZoomableImage-caption">The hipster cafe in Singapore I&#x27;m at right now <span class="ZoomableImage-attribution">(image<span> via <a href="https://www.aspirantsg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AspirantSG</a></span>)</span></small></span></p><h3>Con: Holidays and vacations are unpaid</h3><p>While self-employment allows for more travel, the downside is that you&#x27;re not getting paid for these &quot;days off&quot; anymore.  Because of this, I always try to plan for a few work sessions during my travel.  I don&#x27;t mind this because I love checking out local coffeeshops, but this may be tough for those who like to completely forget about work during vacations.</p><p>The no paid leave affects holidays as well.  While my salaried friends are always looking to spend the long weekends having fun, I&#x27;m conscious of the work hours that I&#x27;m losing.  My compromise is usually to take off the three-day weekend of the holiday, and then make up the hours either the weekend before or after the holiday.</p><h3>Con: It&#x27;s harder to build out your professional network</h3><p>One disadvantage that I didn&#x27;t foresee was losing out of the networking opportunities that come from working at an established company.  When you’re at a company, you not only have access to your immediate colleagues and team, but also to the broader employee roster through corporate events.  To meet more people in my field of work, I started going to more meetups but have found it difficult to build long-lasting relationships.</p><p>A few months ago, I decided to join a co-working space and have been extremely pleased with the decision.  I chose the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nyc.socialinnovation.org/">Centre for Social Innovation in New York</a>, which has been great.  They have events designed specifically for members to network and meet each other.  (Note: not all co-working spaces are designed for people to meet, so if that is important to you, make sure you do your research before signing up!)</p><p><span class="ZoomableImage-container"><img alt="Centre for Social Innovation" src="//images.contentful.com/ei622yk3qctu/1KWkEnwAYo2MOK4E8iA40e/1704a2066d9917277030178958a24d63/IMG_2410.jpg" class="ZoomableImage"/><small class="ZoomableImage-caption">The awesome co-working space that I work out of <span class="ZoomableImage-attribution">(image<span> via <a href="http://www.artinfactmag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Art InFact</a></span>)</span></small></span></p><h3>Pro: You choose what you want to work on</h3><p>The power to choose what to work on is the main reason I started freelancing, and I&#x27;m happy to say that so far I&#x27;ve only worked on projects that I truly wanted to be a part of.  It helped that I knew what I wanted to focus on: helping early-stage startups build out their product.  This allowed me to highlight the relevant experience in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://golmansax.com/portfolio">my portfolio</a>, which made it easier to secure the opportunities that I wanted.</p><p>In addition, I&#x27;m happy that I&#x27;ve been able to be selective when choosing which companies I work for.  It&#x27;s important to me that my work is being used to support society in a manner that I believe in, and because I make the final call, I haven&#x27;t had to compromise on this.</p><hr/><p>I hope you enjoyed reading my thoughts on self-employment.  If you&#x27;re thinking about the switch, in my opinion the main thing to consider is whether the work flexibility is worth the sacrifices that come with not having a full-time job.  It was well worth it for me, but everyone is different!</p><p>Have any questions about my transition to being self-employed?
